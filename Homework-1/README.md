## Dependencies
Python 3.0 or greater: must have the new "queue" implementation for priority queue rather then the old pre 3.0 "Queue"
Numpy (1.18.5): should work for any version, I just use it to create an adjacency matrix with a shape.
 
if you plan on building the docs yourself, you need markdown-pdf, but since I already built them and include a copy, this is unnecessary.
 
## structure:
* `/docs/`: assignment report source and build
    * `docs.md`: assignment report source in markdown 
    * `docs.pdf`: assignment report as PDF 
* `/output/`: console outputs from experiments
    * `Problem1.txt`: console output from problem 1
    * `Problem1.txt`: console output from problem 2
* `/source/`: experiment source code
    * `P1.py`: source code for problem 1
    * `P2.py`: source code for problem 2
* `buildDocs.bat`: script to build the assignment report
* `run.bat`: script to run experiments and generate output
